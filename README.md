# particle-simulation

A simple particle simulation written in C. This is an attempt to implement something similar to
Hunar Ahmad's [particle-life](https://github.com/hunar4321/particle-life) project in C. I have
only dabbled with C so if anyone with more experience sees something I can improve on, please
let me know. C can be a bit tricky at times for me.

## Dependencies

I use SDL2 to facility image creation. So you will need to have this library on your machine
to compile the code. I only made this to run on linux although I am sure it wouldn't be hard
to make it compatible to other platforms.
